# WhatsApp Indexer Enhancement - Solution Summary

## Problem Solved ✅

**Original Issue:** The query "when did I meet with Yahav" failed to find that you met with Yahav 2 days ago, even though the planning conversation was in your WhatsApp messages.

**Root Cause:** The system had several limitations:
1. **Group chat context loss** - Didn't search group chats when asking about specific people
2. **Hebrew language processing** - Failed to understand Hebrew meeting terms like "על האש מחר"
3. **Date interpretation** - Couldn't map "2 days ago" to find planning conversations
4. **Meeting detection** - Didn't recognize Hebrew planning language as meeting-related

## Solution Implemented 🚀

### 1. Hebrew Processing Engine (`src/hebrew-processor.js`)

**Hebrew Date Mapping:**
- אתמול → yesterday
- מחר → tomorrow  
- לפני יומיים → 2 days ago
- השבוע שעבר → last week

**Hebrew Meeting Terms:**
- על האש → planned scheduled meeting on fire
- נפגש → meet met meeting
- פגישה → meeting appointment
- בשעה → at time

**Meeting Context Detection:**
- Analyzes Hebrew text for meeting indicators
- Provides confidence scores (90% for "על האש מחר")
- Detects confirmation words like "כן", "בטח"

### 2. Enhanced Database Methods (`src/database.js`)

**New Method: `findPersonInAllChats()`**
- Searches for a person across ALL chats (individual + groups)
- Proper timestamp handling (milliseconds)
- Date range filtering with Hebrew support
- Context-aware results

### 3. New MCP Tool: `find_person_conversations`

**Perfect for queries like:**
- "when did I meet with Yahav"
- "מתי נפגשתי עם יהב"
- "what did [person] say about tomorrow"

**Features:**
- Searches across all chat types
- Hebrew-aware date processing
- Meeting context detection
- Confidence scoring

### 4. Enhanced Search (`search_messages`)

**Improvements:**
- Hebrew query processing
- Automatic person detection
- Meeting term enhancement
- Context-aware results
